/**
 * GraphQL.js provides a reference implementation for the GraphQL specification
 * but is also a useful utility for operating on GraphQL files and building
 * sophisticated tools.
 *
 * This primary module exports a general purpose function for fulfilling all
 * steps of the GraphQL specification in a single operation, but also includes
 * utilities for every part of the GraphQL specification:
 *
 *   - Parsing the GraphQL language.
 *   - Building a GraphQL type schema.
 *   - Validating a GraphQL request against a type schema.
 *   - Executing a GraphQL request against a type schema.
 *
 * This also includes utility functions for operating on GraphQL types and
 * GraphQL documents to facilitate building tools.
 *
 * You may also import from each sub-directory directly. For example, the
 * following two import statements are equivalent:
 *
 *     import { parse } from 'graphql';
 *     import { parse } from 'graphql/language';
